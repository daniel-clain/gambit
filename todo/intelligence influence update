* intelligent fighter defends and looks for attacking fighter to have low energy
  - more energy down on attack, (spirit down only if blocked/dodged)
  
how does intelligence (stupidity) factor in
==============================================
* intelligent fighter will
  - check behind to not get flanked
    ~ any fighter will withdraw from flanked but an intelligent fighter will thing to check
  - reposition on the outside to avoid being flanked
    ~ a stupid fighter (and aggressive) fighter will go to fight whoever they can see
  - if flanked critically, and intelligent fighter will fast retreat
  - when low spirit
    ~ a fighter (non aggressive) will use fast retreat
      - an intelligent fighter will consider how much stamina he and the opponent will have
        - if intelligent fighter has higher than half and other fighter has lower than half, and other has higher spirit, then int fighter will look to defend then counter attack
        - where as stupid fighter will fast retreat on low spirit regardless (coward mechanic)
