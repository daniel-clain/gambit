* if a fighters been out of action for long enough, they start a passive slow recovery

* only landing attacks can take a fighters spirit to max, otherwise half way is max
  - if out of action for too long spirit goes to half

* spirit, stamina and energy recover slowly over time, but recover quicker when recovering

* if a fighter has max stamina and out of combat for too long, and they dont have low spirit: then they can use a speed boost to run down enemy
* fast retreat is the fastest move, but it depletes energy quickly

* energy affects attack speed
  - more energy down on attack, (spirit down only if blocked/dodged)

  
* intelligent fighter defends and looks for attacking fighter to have low energy
  - more energy down on attack, (spirit down only if blocked/dodged)
