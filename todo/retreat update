* there are 3 kinds of retreat
  - cautious, defending while moving away, uses no energy, is to safely get out of range
  - normal retreat
    - only used when flanked or to reposition
    - uses small energy for medium speed
  - fast retreat
    - fast speed but uses large energy
    - only used when slow stamina/spirit, or close retreat from flanked
    - cant be started if not high energy(2/3 or bigger
    - fast retreat continues until gets to edge or trapped or recovered stam/spirit
    - continues even if no energy, goes from fast to normal speed

* a cautious retreat is only to get out of striking range, and then a fast retreat
