how should i do docs
=====================
* challenges
  - categorisation
    ~ items could be logical under 1 branch, but also under another
    ~ solution: categories are broken down into 2 types, major, and tags
      * major is high level separation of concern, eg fighting, lawyers, loanshark, betting
      * tags is within a major, and arent relevant in any other
        - examples of how tags work
          ~ an intelligent fighter will have a higher chance to do intelligent things, eg he will wait to defend an attack and then take the opportunity to counter attack
