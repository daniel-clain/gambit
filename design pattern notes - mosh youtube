notes
=============
* focus on the art of designing software, not just a catalog of patterns
* focus how how to structure, and how they should collaborate
* focus on building reusable and extensible software
* design patterns are elegant solutions to repeating problems
* a design pattern should show you how to structure you classes and how these classes should talk to each other
* gang of 4 patterns, 24 design patterns in 3 categories
* the 3 categories of design patterns are:
  - creation: different ways to create object
  - structure: relationship between objects 
  - behavior: interaction between objects
* one of the main benefits of understanding design patterns is to allow developers to be on the same page when communicating about software design
