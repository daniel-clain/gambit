☐ post attack is always miss because it doesnt see the result stored by the do attack 
☐ fight is draw if all fighters are dead, fight doesnt gen, goes straight to end
☐ stam and energy passive regen
☐ effect of low energy
☐ defend should consider how far they are away
☐ ive remove effect sick has on speed, make sure sick hallucinating and injured do something, with visual states so its obvious
☐ make sure all time stepactions are being played
☐ make sure actions are properly interupted, i have an account of a post critical strike miss at the same time as a taking a hit, and post kick miss wasnt interupted, so it did knockout then kick cooldown model
