
Bug:

  ☐ loadshark debt warning logs, pay 50 reset weeks, bug
  ☐ more obvious to recontract your fighter
  ☐ must be a memory leak, starts at 780kb, goes to 23mb, after 55days
  ☐ game.implementation.ts:225,  name: state.playerHasVictory.name, Cannot read property 'name' of null
  ☐ bug: news articles show multiple times
  ☐ if many news articles, they show too quickly
  ☐ reduce height to avoid scroll
  ☐ make re check server code different so no need for client refresh
  ☐ end game stats
  ☐ info icons for more details on what things do
  ☐ more time, especially in late game eg 4 fighters or main event
  ☐ game display try to frame arena better
  ☐ make sure at least 1 lawyer

  ☐ explain multiple guarding, skill level and probability
  ☐ explain assasin probability
  ☐ explain agent do survailance
  ☐ explain agent investigate manager, show stats straight away

Deal Breakers:
  ☐ fix fighter selection, should be propper random
  ☐ reposition should be lower priority if they are far away and not targeting this fighter
  ☐ players can concede, if only 1 player left they win by default
  ☐ reposiont doesnt dedicate tto going around, it can freeze left right twitching, back and forth
  ☐ make sure top fighters are in main event

  ☐ coins doint all spill at same point
  ☐ rampage too often
  ☐ flanked retreat speed too fast
  ☐ trappend in the corner doesnt go rampage, different mode desperation (turn left and right blocking only counter attacking)


Priority:
  ☐ wealth victory has been disabled, is it better to include it, how should it work exactly
  ☐ shorten the view to account for the browser space at the top (see if you can capture the actual browser bar height value)
  ☐ fight view mute button
  ☐ loan shark removes broke players from the game
  ☐ main event fight, you can vote for 3 people to win
  ☐ explain spirit and stamina mechanic
  ☐ winning main event should give big base amount
  ☐ explain stats go down over time
  ☐ explain injured
  ☐ do surveilance should report positive things when no negative things
  ☐ add move type run away to recover, and when far away enought, higher chance to recover
  ☐ more info about abilities, like what chance they have of success, and when it is actioned, if it can be done multiple times, 
  ☐ thug guarding fight, when successful guard, chance to catch evidence
  ☐ fighters recontract is more based on that fighters wins, so the fighter gets expensive over time also based on promotion rating
  ☐ evidence can be sold for bribing, you give that player evidence for money, if sold back to person who was culprit, then evidence is destroyed for money
  ☐ redo betting in a way that scales, and is based on ods
  ☐ after videos, show winner and losers table
  ☐ video for fail weath victory
  ☐ game display, during fight, show player bets and fighter stats
  ☐ set up display for fight, news
  ☐ defend + retreat never really has its value, because the backward movement makes all on range targeting miss, so the righter never has a chance to block and get the bonuses that come with that.
  ☐ user manual to check mechanics (when being prosecuted bad employees dont act)
  ☐ make an info object that is both the config for the game, and also the 'how to play manual'
  ☐ When a manager has a lawsuit targeting him, the chance of being guilty for each is increased by 2% per evidence of that type
  ☐ option to turn sound off if game display active
  ☐ on player disconnect pause all stage (fight), pause in fight is buggy
