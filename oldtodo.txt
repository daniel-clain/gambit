== High Level Priority ==
1. make the game convenient to play with mates
2. refactor the code to be presentable in interviews
3. solve general problems
4. add features

=======================================================

1. make the game convenient to play with mates
*show each player post fight report info (rename to end round info)
* dont know how much money was made, add post fight info
* put fighter expiring each round at the top of teh log list
* -code for trapped

* poison small chance to kill
* fight ui show fight promotion rating
* cant have 2 flanking pairs that are the same 2 fighters
* arena zoom to fit screen size
* bug where rememberedEnemyBehind doesnt clear (think its to do with timer not reseting it)
* retreat from flanked, reposition and retreat around edge face direction of reterat


=======================================================

3. solve general problems
* refactor fight-ui to be more logical, simpler, cleaner, separation of concerns, abstraction
* allow for multiple game displays


-------------------------------------------------------

* end of manager phase and fight, save fight data obj file onto server, if server fails, you can recreate off saved game
* throw validation errors back to the client, (id already exists, server is down, cant connect wrong port)
* make client know when the server has crashed
* determineIfFlanked is causing call stack exceeded error, too many calls, figure out what data is needed and the easiest way to get it
* loan shark says overdue when owes 0
* make the game work with public ip 
* make all serverside socket event get handled in the same place and branch outward, use game id. (rather than socke.on happening for an arbitrary point within the game)
* try to use babel to make ui look the same in Edge





* generate fighter match history
* when fighter wins, make money relative to their odds

*make manager options stage 3 mins, make 10 seconds remaining obvious
* make knows fighters a lot smaller(maybe button that opens card), use space for other stuff
*-loanshark charging double interest(cant replicate, try with multiplayer)
*phone only connects if on the wifi
* know who you bet on and how much u made
* handle disconnecting player

*cornered enemy distance to edge should be based on base box edges, not center point (occurs most in leftBottom and rightBottom)

*goal contract not showing in fighter card for job seeking fighters sometimes
* preload images
* winner text centered in arena
* fighter can target fighter while standing on same y value (should move to attack from accurate range)
* attack should not miss if moves closer
*sound playing when start fight(cant replicate single player)

* intelligent guy gettin stuck in the middle
* fighter start positions make them more random
*fighters get stuck on diagonal
* does a fighter recover stam and spirit if interupted
* fighters with low intelligence need to do unintelligent things
* add recovery based on fitness

*on ability card, click on source or target to see their card
*marker next to your fighters and knowfighter if fighter is in fight
*add recovery stat
*talent scout prioritized for research over private agent

ongoing
=======
*spelling mistakes


minor
======
* stats have a random chance to decrease each round, higher based on how high the stats are
* get manager pics for players to pick

Ideas
=========================
* random events
- fighter with high publicity get attacked by a fan
- agency checks fighters for doping and removes them if found
- fighters get food poisoning
- royal rumble, 8 fighters, winner makes x4 money
- police arest drug dealer
- fighter get injured from excessive exercise

* manager can expend action points to make small amounts of money
* states like poisoning, injured and doping persist mutiple rounds and go down over time
*fighter can be injured from fight
*injured can give concussion which reduces intellignce
* can see fighters in next weeks fight
* injured or poisoned cant get put in fight
* doping permanantly increases agression and decreases intelligence, too much doping fighter can die
* remove activity log, replace with pre post news updates
* other managers panel, shows known info about other managers
* discover fighter ability, finds fighters that are unknown with minimal stats
* your fighter ability, 'take a dive', intentionally lose 
*talent scout skill level influences offer contract success
