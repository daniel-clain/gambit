ongoing
=======
*spelling mistakes


minor
======
* stats have a random chance to decrease each round, higher based on how high the stats are
* get manager pics for players to pick

Ideas
=========================
* random events
- fighter with high publicity get attacked by a fan
- agency checks fighters for doping and removes them if found
- fighters get food poisoning
- royal rumble, 8 fighters, winner makes x4 money
- police arest drug dealer
- fighter get injured from excessive exercise

* manager can expend action points to make small amounts of money
* states like poisoning, injured and doping persist mutiple rounds and go down over time
*fighter can be injured from fight
*injured can give concussion which reduces intellignce
* can see fighters in next weeks fight
* injured or poisoned cant get put in fight
* doping permanantly increases agression and decreases intelligence, too much doping fighter can die
* remove activity log, replace with pre post news updates
* other managers panel, shows known info about other managers
* discover fighter ability, finds fighters that are unknown with minimal stats
