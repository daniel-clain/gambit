* coding is hard
  - there is often no 1 right way to do things
  - dont be too critical of myself or others if code is not perfect
    ~ either leave good peer review or let it slide
  - the principles and patterns are there to help you, but they are bad if you dont stick to them
  - its easy to make basic mistakes, unit tests can give you peace of mind that a function does what it should
