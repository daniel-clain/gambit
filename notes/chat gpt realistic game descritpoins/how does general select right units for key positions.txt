Determining the command structure beneath a general in a medieval army involved careful consideration of various factors, including skill, experience, loyalty, and trust. Here's how a general might decide on the command structure and the importance of selecting the right individuals for key positions:

1. **Assessment of Skills and Experience:**
   - Generals would assess the skills and experience of their officers based on their past performance in battles, leadership abilities, and knowledge of military tactics and strategy.
   - They might consider factors such as previous command positions held, combat record, training, and specialization in specific types of warfare (e.g., cavalry, infantry, siege warfare).

2. **Loyalty and Trustworthiness:**
   - Loyalty was paramount for medieval generals. They sought officers who were loyal to their lord or king, committed to the cause, and trustworthy in their actions.
   - They would consider an officer's reputation for reliability, integrity, and willingness to follow orders without question.

3. **Leadership Qualities:**
   - Generals looked for officers with strong leadership qualities, including the ability to inspire and motivate troops, make sound decisions under pressure, and maintain discipline and order within their units.
   - They valued officers who led by example, exhibited courage on the battlefield, and earned the respect of their subordinates.

4. **Strategic Vision and Initiative:**
   - Some positions within the command structure required individuals who could think strategically, anticipate enemy movements, and make independent decisions when necessary.
   - Generals sought officers who demonstrated initiative, creativity, and adaptability in responding to changing battlefield conditions and opportunities.

5. **Communication and Coordination:**
   - Effective communication and coordination were essential for the smooth functioning of the command structure. Generals appointed officers who could effectively relay orders, coordinate movements between units, and maintain cohesion on the battlefield.
   - They looked for individuals with strong interpersonal skills, the ability to work well with others, and a talent for fostering teamwork and cooperation.

Selecting the best person for each command position could make a significant difference in the army's performance and ultimately the outcome of battles. A capable and competent officer could inspire troops, improve morale, enhance coordination, and make strategic decisions that led to victory. Conversely, choosing someone less qualified or reliable could undermine the effectiveness of the army, leading to confusion, disorganization, and potentially defeat.

In summary, medieval generals considered factors such as skills, experience, loyalty, leadership qualities, strategic vision, initiative, and communication when determining the command structure beneath them. Selecting the right individuals for key positions was crucial for the success of the army and maximizing its capabilities on the battlefield.
