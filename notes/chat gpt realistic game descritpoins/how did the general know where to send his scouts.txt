Strategic Objectives:
Generals would prioritize scouting missions based on their strategic objectives. This could include identifying enemy positions, monitoring enemy movements, locating supply lines, or assessing the terrain for potential battlefield advantages.
They would consider factors such as the proximity of enemy territories, the direction of potential enemy advances, and key locations that could influence the outcome of the battle or campaign.
Knowledge of the Enemy:
Generals would utilize intelligence gathered from spies, captured enemies, or local informants to identify areas of interest for reconnaissance.
They would focus scouting efforts on areas where enemy activity was suspected or where vulnerabilities were likely to be found, such as weak points in their defenses or routes of approach.
Understanding of Terrain:
Knowledge of the terrain was crucial for medieval generals. They would send scouts to reconnoiter areas of strategic importance, such as mountain passes, river crossings, or dense forests, where the enemy could exploit natural defenses or launch ambushes.
Scouts would also search for advantageous positions for their own forces, such as high ground or defensible positions, and report back to the general with their findings.
Communication Networks:
Generals maintained communication networks with their subordinate commanders, who would provide information about their respective areas of operation.
Scouts and reconnaissance units would be directed to areas where additional information was needed or where enemy movements were suspected based on reports from frontline units.
