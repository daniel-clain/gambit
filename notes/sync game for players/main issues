# issues

- the logged time of each device is not the same
- parths time starts in negative numbers
- what if the fight tries to process the fight obj after the start time
  ~ should not bug out, should still be able to calculate the current time from the start time and run the fight from there

# requirements

- prove all assets are preloaded so no lag in render
- when a clients gets a package, react should rerender based on start time vs iso time
- countdown time should only show if time is before start time, if its after, it should go from the current time

discovered answers

- iso time is unrelable cos its based on the client machine
- Unix timestamp is perfectly reliable because its not related to the machine and give the same relative value regardless of location
