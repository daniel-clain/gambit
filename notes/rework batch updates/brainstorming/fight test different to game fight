- fight should be clean and not hacky for both modes

- fight test should have ( that game version doesnt)

  - default list of fighters that can be included/excluded from the ui
  - ui should allow for new fighters to be created that are included/excluded
  - ui should allow to select any fighter in the list and change their name and stats
    ~ including poisoned/assaulted/halucination/

- both should have

  - new fight created with
    ~ list of fighters

  - fight pause/unpause

- game version should have (that fight test doesnt)

  - manager bets

- same but different
  - fighter info panel
    ~ fight test should have all info

- take 'fight report' out of fight, concept of report is not needed, game mode should use winner or draw to determine bet results

# susinct fight test logic

{
on start click, start a fight with fighters from config list
}

# both ui

- arena should show before fight is generated
- when fight is generated/paused/unpaused, fight view should get a prop update
  - logic should
    ~ see the future start time and wait for time until rouded whole seconds and then start a loop that runs every second that decrements start countdown to 0
    ~ when the start time is 0, the start animation should play, and the time step loop should start
    ~ the time step loop should run every
