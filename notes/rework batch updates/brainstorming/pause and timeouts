- problem, when a fighter component is built, it gets an update to servertimestep and fightisrunning at the same time which runs both use effect blocks, its not obvious which runs first

- create timeouts should be their start time after server start time

- on unpause, set start time to 3 secs before future date, fight time hook should see start time in futuer and do 3 sec coundown

- it seems there should never be a scenario where fight reloads where start time isnt reset in the future
  - a browser refresh should trigger a disconnect then reconnect, which should trigger a pause unpause, and unpause should set the start time 3 secs in the future

# restarting fight

- in fight test, if the new fight button is clicked
  - the fighter components dont update because they dont see any change
    ~ its only looking for the fight is running dependency which doesnt change, because it should be stopped by the date becomming in the future
