- actions are a messy thought that needs refining
- problematic things
  - punch, kick, knocked out dont have duration
  - chaining actions is a bit confusing
  - the responsiblity of an action is spread out
    ~ sound, name, modle, effect, chaining, duration, resolveStep,
  - tried to simplify made it more confusing, by putting name duration and action, the idea was a general function would determine the model and sound, but it isnt less code, and it is more confusing
  - fighter fighing is like a fighter specific place to handle the action before more general fight, however doing things before sening it to fight, the next action doesnt get a chance to have thos same things done
