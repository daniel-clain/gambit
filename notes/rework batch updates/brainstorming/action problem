- currently things knocked out is being set as an action even though its not, just to get the model of the fighter sent in the timestamp chain,

- the current idea is
  - when generating the fight, the fighter cant start its next action until it current action is duration is resolved
  - if a fighter is attacked, its current action is removed and a response action in added
  - the fight schedule and the fight action que is different in the way that
    ~ the action que is for generating the fight and the schedule if for running the fight on the frontend
    ~ the fronend sechedule stamp holds that fighter state as long as its time stamp is the active one based on the current fight step
    ~ the action que can have a chain of actions, if the current one is interupted, then all subsequent actions are also dropped
