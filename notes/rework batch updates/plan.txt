* understand existing way and how to translate it into new way
  - existing way 
    ~ sends updates every 60 milisecs
    ~ fighters do their own thing based on current state
    ~ actions like move, attack, rest take timeout

  - updated way 
    ~ entire fight sent in 1 batch
    ~ no abilites take time, they only register time
    ~ compares time stamps to know 



* example to demonstrate the problem and solution
  - problem is
    ~ delayed effects should only effect state after simulated time has stepped to it
    ~ when f3 takes action on f2, it should be based on state before f2 has state update resolved


 * simulate fight has fighters
  - fake time steps each loop,
  - each loop it checks events list and executes any event that is due and effectst he global state
