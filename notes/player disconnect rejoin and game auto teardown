player disconnect and rejoin
====================================
* when a player disconnects
 - the game pauses
 - other players get a popup where they chose to agree to drop the other player
 - while disconnected, the player can rejoin with the same client id and username, when they reconnect they will get a new socket number, the new socket number replaces the original, and then the game continues after a 3 second count down


server bug out game restart
=================================
* if the server crashes while a games in progress
 - the game will be able to be salvaged from a backup json file
* after every week, the game automatically backs itself up on the server to a saved game<gameID>.json file on the server, storing the state of the game
* if the server goes down, you go back to the page that you can start the game server from, all players and displays reconnect, one of the players sees the saved game in a list and selects it, other connected players join that game, the game will expect a match on all names and client ids, when there is a match on all, the host can start and it will go from where the last save point was
*if server starts and there is a a autosave game thats 20min old, delete it
*if there is an intentional save gamem, give player the option to delete it


game auto teardown
=========================
* when a game finishes, game displays a game over view with game summary, this is a static view with data, the game instace in the background is no longer needed so the instance is deleted
* if a game is paused from player disconnect, if all players vote disconnect then game instance tearsdown
* if game is paused and is idle for 5 mins then instance will teardown
* if all players disconnect game instance will tear down
* on game teardown, look for any saved json for that game and remove that aswell


player rejoin same name different id
=====================================
*if player disconnects and rejoins on different device, they will have a new client id, if they connect with the same name, prompt the user if they want to claim that paused player session
