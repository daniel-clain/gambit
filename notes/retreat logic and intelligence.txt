retreat logic considering intelligence

* factors
	- proximity
	- stamina
	- spirit
	- rampage
	- targeted
	- enemy behind
	- aggression
	- speed
	- intelligence
	

* how to make intelligence work
	- do stupid stuff unless intelligent
	- base probability for obvious things that dont require intelligence
	- the more intelligent the mechanic, the higher the intelligence factor
	
* key considerations
	- the numbers not only have to be in balance within retreat, but also in balance to all the other probabilities
	- what is the difference between not intelligent and aggressive
		~ what does agressive and intelligent look like, what does unagressive and unintelligent look like
			* unagressive would rather retreat than attack
		~ unintelligent
			* attack while enemy defending
			* not retreat while low stamina
			* not refresh who is behind him
			* Attack when they're in a vulnerable position. 
			* Defend when the enemy is in a vulnerable position
			
* factors details
	- speed
		~ intelligent fighters know that running away fighters that are faster than you is not worth it
			* unless there are other fighters nearby that the other fighter could be distracted by
	- proximity
		~ if you turn to retreat in striking distance, then there is a high chance to get attacked in the back
		~ if enemy fighters are far away, then maybe its an opportunity to recover instead of still retreating
	- stamina
		~ intelligent fighters know that if there are other fighters, they have a chance to create some distance and recover stamina
	- spirit
		~ when in high spirits, a fighter will want to keep fighting, if a fighter is in low spirits they will want to run away
	- rampage
		~ a fighter does not retreat when rampaging
		~ an intelligent fighter will take advantage of a rampaging fighter 
			- attack when their back is turned
			- defend, if has faster speed, try to counter attack, if not, keep defending till rampage is over
			- high chance to retreat if they are near, low chance to retreat if they are close
	- targeted
		~ an intelligent fighter does not retreat from nearby fighters if they arent targeting him, he would rather take the chance to reposition, recover or look for a cheapshot
		~ an intelligent fighter will not start to recover if there is a nearby enemy targeting him, or he has no memory of whats behind
		
	- enemy behind
		~ an intelligent fighter will not from an enemy infront into an enemy behind, he instead will retreat from flanked
