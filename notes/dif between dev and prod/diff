- dev and prod have nothing to do with the environment in which it is being run

- prod is

  - smallest minified bundle without anything it doesnt need

- dev is

  - best user experience for developer so they can easily work on the app

- prod can be run in a local environment and dev can be run on the remote host.

- the cicd pipeline should

  - get the production version of the app onto the remote host and run it

- factors to consider for remote host
  - it costs money, based on size used, so node modules will take up a lot of space, and the source code will take up a lot of space(coppies of the image and video assets)
