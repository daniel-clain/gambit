*Think the movie fight club. It's an underground organised fight where each week 4 guys fight in an arena, every man for himself.
* You dont play as a fighter, you play as a 'manager'  on the outside.
* Your goal is to make money and squash your opponents out of the contest. Your opponents are other players playing as managers.
* You make money by betting on who will win each fight
* You choose who to bet on by considering what you know
* Each week you have limited action points, you can use action points to investigate a fighter to learn info about him. But you can also use your action points to hire employees, like a talent scout, who can investigate fighters for you.
* A big part of it is you can offer a fighter a contract to fight for you
* While hes fighting for you you can train him to improve his stats
* If he wins you make considerably more money.
* You can hire a personal trainer to train your fighters for you* YOu can do malicious things to influence the fight, you can hire thugs to assault a fighter before the fight giving him a low chance of winning
* You can slander a fighter you can drug him so hell have a bad performance
* you can do other things like give your fighter performance enhancers 
* You can hire body guards to protect your fighter from assault and drugging.
*You can hire a private investigator to find out if a manager sent thugs or drugged your guy
* When you have evidence you can hire lawyers to sue an opponent for bad actions
* Fighters have stats: strengt, speed, toughness, revocery, happiness, aggression, intelligence.
* All the stats influence how they fight. For example a fighter with high speed has a high chance of dodging the attack of someone wtih lower speed, a guy with high intelligence will have a highe chance not to expose his back to an enemy, a guy with low spirites and low stamina will withdraw and recover
*You can hire PR people to hype up your fighter. Higher his PR hype means more chance to be in fights and more money in the total prize pool. 
*The amount you make is relative to his probability of your selected fighter winning, eg, if the system calculates that that fighter has the lowers odds you will make money off him that the Fighter that has the highest odds
* So if you manage a fighter and hes hyped up and in a fight but he has low odds - you can can poison the biggest threat, dope ur guy up on perfomance enhancers, assault the 2nd best fighter with thugs, and then put a huge bet on your fighter. Then if he wins you make mega mega bucks
* But if the other player is savy, he'll put body guards on his guy to catch the agent trying to poison him, he can send his own agent to find out you're doping your guy, then ur guy gets banned from the next 3 fightsand the you have to pay a fine. then the other guy wins and you lose heaps while the other guy makes huge amouts of money
* Each player does the manager stage on their mobile phone, but then the fight stage is done on a big sreen tv for everyone to watch.
* There is a news event before each fight gibing infor of what was the results of the manager phase, you get limited info so that you have to deduce certain things, you can see who eachother bet on but not how much. At then end you can see who won and how much
* If youre low on money you can borrow from the loan shark. But if you dont pay him back in time then he will send thugs to assault your fighters
