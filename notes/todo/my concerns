- how can i make it so players cant drop out when the game is playing

  - if they change thier active app is that counted as a dropout
  - if they refresh the app should it auto return them to the game or not (if so, should they be able to exit )

- responsive scaling of the fight

  - fight makes more sense in landscape, should i redo the layout for manager options to be more suited to landscape
  - should different actions cost more action points
    ~ should action points be based on how much time you have left

- lots of players, lots of news, what if there are 10 news items

* investigate manage shows stats of manager but its not that useful compared, surveilance is better

* investigate when it reveals loan it says undefined, should say 'no loan or something

* surveilance on a fighter seems not as good as on a manager

* give an idea of total employable characters there are, and total fights, so you can get and idea of what total ratio you have encountered

* employees should have multiple abilites, and they should take them a certain amount of time

  - different ability cost
  - different activation time
  - deepre mechanic, once you sent you drug dealer, he goes for 2 days, and brings back more, but while hes gone, you cant use doping or poison
  - secret agent can, in one turn, do research a figher or research a manager, and you can finish the turn while he doing surveilance
  - its not well communicated if an employee atempts and fails
  - mechanic for more money relative to how manny vs how many competitors you have, eg caps out at 3 drug dealers they have none is the most possible (4 doesnt give extra), if you have 4 and they have 1, you dont get the most, their 1 has a stronger influence, because the price is competitive
  - training gives more value exponentially, relative to the trainer sill level, however training makes you have disadvantage on fight day, small chance of injured

* give players an idea of the maths of how much they make, flat amount plus portion of winning, plus sponsor modifier

* explain the effects of assault poison, hallucinate, dope, and beserk are

* explain squat to recover health

* does it make more or less sense to expose extra info, eg
  - are they running away, are they repositioning, how much stamina do they have, how much energy do they have
  - recovering as they move away
  - there are currently things that are visually depicted
    ~ rampage, spirit, recovering,
