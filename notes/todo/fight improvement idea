the key to make the game good is to have things represented visually

- eg if a guy takes a kick, then that symbolises the kick coming, then when the guy does the take a hit frame, you can see thats the point in which he tames the damage

* the idea is, instead basic mechanics for the progress of a fight, a more advanced one that tells a story

* i take a phot o of each cousin doing the poses

* make the game have different genders for fighters and employees
