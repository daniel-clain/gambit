* abilities have validation of the source and target
  - if ability is invalid, its grey
  - if its clicked on, ability card with error msg and grey buttons
  - if grey buttons clicked on then error alert thrown

* differentiate between 2 different ideas, invalid vs requirements not met
  - eg if you click on an employee, only abilities that employee can do are valid and only those will show, eg private agent abilities does not include promote because its invalid
  - however, private agent has poison ability, but if you dont have a drug dealer, then the requirements are not met

* logic for valid source and target are similar but different


* problem, client doesnt have all data
  - resolve as much on server, send client minimal


* as you click on any job seeker, employee, fighter, manager
  - car will show 
  - all ability blocks will show
    ~ invalid ones are greyed out


* what is the scope of abilities
  - source can only be employees and managers
  - target can only be job seeker, fighter, manager
  - some abilities dont have target eg sell drugs
  - abilities activate at different points
  - some targets can be targeted by the same ability multiple times

* existing hacks
