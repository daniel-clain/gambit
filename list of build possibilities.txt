- webpack does 2 things, bundles, and serves
- server has 2 purposes, gamehost, and server frontend
- difference between dev and prod mode  is prod mode doesnt have helper dependencies, minifies, and hides env varaibles
- local and remote are different from dev and prod, just cos usually local is dev and remote is prod, doesnt mean you shouldt be aloowed to do a prod build local or a dev build remote
- the primary builds i need are, remote prod mainGame, local dev mainGame fightTest localTest.
- there are 2 environments: local and remote, there are 2 build modes: dev and prod, there are 3 client packages: mainGame, localTest, fightTest
