Why doesnt it work
- because old code had a different appoach for client communicating with back end code and thats been removed

How does it get fixed
- The code should be modular, each module should work in isolation
- It should be easy to integrate back into the rest of the code, if it isnt, its been badly archtected
- The test uis level of abstraction from the rest of the game should only need to work with fight class
- The setup should be configuring who is fighting
- The should be a new class for handling the event output by the fight class, and should be responsible firing off redux state update actions
