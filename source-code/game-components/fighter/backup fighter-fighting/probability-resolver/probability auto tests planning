factors
=============
* closeness: striking, close, near, far
* state: spirit, energy, stamina, rampage
* proximity: flanked, against edge, trapped
* stats: intelligence, strength, aggression, fitness
* timers: just (dodged, blocked, took hit, attacked, had action, memory behind)
* current move action: strategic, desperate, cautious, attacking
* enemy: state (facing), stats, action (recovering, desperate)

assertions
=============
* given any combination of possible factors, what should the probability be to do any possible action


how do i code this efficiently
================================
* the more factors there are, there are exponentially more scenarios, coding each one is too hard, what should be done
  - example of 1
    to recover: infront = far, behind = near, stam = low, spirit = high, infront is attacking, behing is not facing

* hypathetically, if i had coded out all scenarios, there would be patterns that would allow me to reduce/simplify to cover a group of scenarios where probability is always relative to the factor, eg close always + 2, near always + 4



i want to ask andrew for his recommendation
================================
* how do i phrase the question so that he understands and i get a useful answer
