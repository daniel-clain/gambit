* eg decided action is to punch but enemy is behind
* code is to turn around and async await for it to finish
* turn around has a cooldown which is chained onto the turn around action 
* if the cooldown action is interupted by an attack, the turn around action isnt considered rejected
* because the turn around action isnt interupted the try to punch action starts
* even tho the fighter takes a hit, and start action, he also immediatly does the try to punch action
* the take a hit cooldown finishes, and the punch cooldown finishes and both start a new decide action
