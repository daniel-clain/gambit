* when retreating past flanker along edge
  - what is the condition for persist to end?
    ~ needs to make it passed the flanker that its moving past
  - what is considered passed
    ~ the x val needs to go passed
      * this could go wrong because once 1px past, then what
        - should drop the persist state, and resume normal decide action
  - what is being persisted
    ~ the state should be active until the condition is met, and the state should affect the logic determining the direction
    ~ the goal is to get from one side of the fighter to the other
    ~ when against edge, and to the right of flanking fighter, should keep moving along the edge until on the left of fighter, or until direction is blocked
  - what data needs to be stored to persist past flanker
    ~ needs to store is moving left or right, and needs to store which fighter hes concerned with
  - what scenarios make persist invalid
    ~ if direction is blocked
    ~ no longer flanked (flanker is knocked out or moves out of flanking range)
    ~ if is against left or right edge and still not passed
  - everytime the fighter finishes a move action, and then decides the next action, how is persist related, isnt there a risk of them chosing another action that retreat and breaking the logic?

  
  - notes:
    ~ along edge scenario is only concerned with x axis (left or right), is not relevant on vertical edges
      


* when retreating between flankers
  - what is considered passed
    ~ when y value goes past
  - when is it invalid
    ~ if fighter is blocking
    ~ no longer flanked (flanker is knocked out or moves out of flanking range or moves past x axis)
