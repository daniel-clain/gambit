* if flanked by 2 on either side
- move away from the 2 directions until at a neraby range or until hit a wall
- when at a nearby range look at which side has the least amount of fighters and move round to that side until all the fighters are on one side and there are none on the other
- if the fighter hits an edge, move along the edge is the closest to the best direction. if fighter at top or btm and flanked, dont defend or retret, only attack. if fighter on diagonal or sides and flanked, defend and counter attack
- the more intelligent the fighter the weighting towards fulfilling the reposition until all fighters on one side and none on the other. only time higher priotiry is when against the edge and flanked

* calculations necessary
- closest 2 flanking fighters
- aware if trapped by 3
- if on edge move along edge in closest direction to desired
- aware if trapped on edge
- if trapped by 3 fighters, find biggest retreat angle of the 3


* how do i make the code not run excessively
- run the code after turning around
- put a timer on running the code so it only runs once within every 1 second
- if in the process of doing it, dont run the check code, only the exectution code
- for detection to edges, only run if within 200 of one of the corners, if is, run different code for diagonals vs sides/topbtm, when finding the closest point on the diagona, start at the nearest end point




=== process for repositioning to outside of fight
* if 2 fighters are opposite sides move away in furthest away angle
* one of 2
  - if hits a wall
    * one of 2
      - if not flanked move along edge thats most away from closest
      -if flanked
        * one of 2
          - if on diagonal or side, defend and counter strike
          - if on top or bottom, attack only
  - if far enough away to no longer be flanked, do reposition action


= reposition action is
* pick the side with the least fighters and move to that side until hit wall or no fighters on that side of you anymore, then return to normal
