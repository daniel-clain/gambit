problem
=========
* if too close, striking center is buggy

details
=============

* if attacking, fighter wants to move to closest coords that make his front striking area enter the enemies closest front or back striking area

* if retreating, striking center may not be appropriate basis, if switched to coords, what would be the side effect?


* what happens if enemy is against a wall, and attacker is trying to move to coords out of bounds
  - if not possible to get to get within closest striking area, move to attack other striking area
