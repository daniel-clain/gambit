main goal
=========== 
* intelligent fighter does not want to have his back to enemies and get surrounded

algorithm key points
======================
* move to based on
  - side with most space
    ~ trying to move to side with no space can get cornered
  - move to side without coming in striking range of enemy


reposition probability
  * invalid if: 
    - within close range
    - if retreat direction is too close to edge
    - no enough space to reposition into
  * if fighters on either side

retreat mechanics
  * move to side that has the most free space
    - even if there is 1 to the left and 5 to the right, if there is no space on the left and heaps on the right, reposition on the right side
  * move directly to the side
    - redirect up or down based on the proximity of the closest fighter
  * once passed all fighters vertically, complete reposition moving more the the center of the edge
