/* 
  - other actions should be high probability and drown out this one based on
    - behind is attacking
      - high chance to retreat
    - if they are close
      - high chance to retreat or attack
    - if not close or attacking 
      - high chance to recover or attack

  - main influence to check is how long its been since

  - if behind is coming to attack
    - makes no sense to increase probability because needs to retreat instead of check
      - standard check based on elapsed should be accurate whether attacking or not, cos if they're not attacking, then this will have a higher relative probability



  - if only small ratio infront, that means large ratio behind
    - makes no sense to increase probability, if lots behind and none are attacking, theyre probably attacking eachother. if 
    
  - if 1 behind and not attacking, makes more sense to check, because eventually he will probably attack
