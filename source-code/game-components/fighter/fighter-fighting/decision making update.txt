* there are situations where they get stuck between. situations:
  - toward edege away from flanked <=> between flanked
  - against edge away edge closest to enemy <=> away

* one they make decision, a timer runs for 1 sec that persists that direction
  - timer scales off movements speed


trap logic
  * if in corner 2 stratiegies, each have scenario where they dont work 
    - strategy 1 
      ~ go to corner on edge furthest away from enemy
      ~ problem: if fighter is 1/7th the way along an edge, and enemy is 3/7th the way along the same edge, fighter is furthest from corner behind enemy, so fighter retreats toward corner behind enemy and toward enemy
    - strategy 2
      ~ go along edge direction that is closest to reatreat from enemy direction 
      ~ problem: if fighter in corner, and enemy is equal distance between both edges, whichever edge is chosen, will hit the logic to retreat from fighter and back toward corner

  * what conditions should trapped logic trigger
    - strategy 2 but only if close
    - they should not go back and forth between logic until trapped
      ~ if a persist action canceled, delay before next decision

  * flaw with persist, 
    - they cant be running through fighters
    - should it end on timer or relative position

  * is a solution to use both? or a persist 
    - strategy 3
      ~ retreat to corner furthest from enemy, if direction blocked, retreat to along edge direction closest to retreat from enemy
      ~ pesist chosen direction for 1 second
      ~ if persist action blocked, cancel persist
      ~ if when deciding, both direction are blocked, trapped

  * factor in distance
    - the closer the enemy the bigger the angl is for considered blocked
      ~ eg:
        * if theyre far, angle for blocked is within 30
        * if close, angle for blocked within 90
