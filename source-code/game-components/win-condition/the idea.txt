* there needs to be a strong way to win because thats what people need, they need a sucess/domination based goal to work toward
* the speed to win is the hightest goal
* you also need to understand the win conditions well to know when is the best time to make an attempt at winning
* if you fail to win it can have a spectrum of negative affects, most likely putting you on the bottom

* one way to win is to declare a grand battle royal. players anonymously vote yes or no, if its more than 30 say yes, it happens. its a multi-stage evet, 4 stages, you have a series of singles fights, then team fight, then top 1v1 fight, then all fighters fight. you are scored for each week and your end score is if ur highest then u win, even if u lost one. you dont see the points you got for each fight until you see the end winner

* attempts to win are no enabled until a certain number of weeks
* you can eliminate people from the game
* as the game goes on, you get to put skill points next to skills you want, they are cheaper the more you have engaged in that type of skill over the game, this idea of skill kinda scopes you in to going for a certain strategy
* before the game starts, you are given a random advantage and disadvantage, that will be your strength and weakness, these can influence the way you play the game
